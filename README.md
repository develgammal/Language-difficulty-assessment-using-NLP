# Multilingual Language Learning Tool

## 📚 Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive language learning tool that analyzes subtitle files (.srt) and provides word difficulty assessments using two distinct computational methodologies. The tool combines natural language processing, machine learning, and data visualization to create an academic experiment comparing different approaches to word difficulty classification.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Topic-based Sentence Grouping**: Automatically group sentences from subtitle files by semantic topics using BERTopic
2. **Dual Word Difficulty Analysis**: Compare two methods for determining word difficulty:
   - **Method A: Word Frequency** - Traditional approach based on corpus frequency
   - **Method B: Embedding L2 Norm** - Experimental approach using embedding magnitudes
3. **Comparative Visualization**: Side-by-side color-coded comparison of both methods

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Virtual environment support (venv)

### Installation

1. **Clone or download this project to your local machine**

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd NLP_UNI_Projekt
   ```

3. **Create and activate the virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python -m venv nlp_env

   # Activate on Windows (Git Bash)
   source nlp_env/Scripts/activate

   # Activate on macOS/Linux
   source nlp_env/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook multilingual_language_learning_tool.ipynb
   ```

## 🔧 Configuration

The notebook includes a central configuration cell where you can customize:

- **Target Language**: Set using ISO 639-1 codes ('es', 'pt', 'fr', 'de', etc.)
- **Subtitle File Path**: Point to your own .srt file
- **Model Selection**: Choose different multilingual models
- **Difficulty Tiers**: Adjust CEFR level boundaries
- **Color Scheme**: Customize visualization colors

## 📊 Features

### Method A: Word Frequency Analysis
- Downloads large corpora using OPUS Books dataset
- Calculates word frequencies across multiple texts
- Maps frequency ranks to CEFR difficulty levels
- Proven approach based on linguistic research

### Method B: Embedding Norm Analysis
- Uses sentence transformer models for multilingual embeddings
- Calculates L2 norms of word embedding vectors
- Novel approach hypothesizing correlation between norm and difficulty
- Handles subword tokenization challenges

### Topic Modeling
- Implements BERTopic for semantic clustering
- Groups sentences by thematic similarity
- Provides context-aware difficulty analysis
- Supports multilingual content

### Visualization & Analysis
- Color-coded sentence display for both methods
- Side-by-side comparison interface
- Quantitative correlation analysis
- Interactive topic exploration

## 🎨 Color Coding System

- 🟢 **A1 (Green)**: Beginner level words
- 🔵 **A2 (Light Green)**: Elementary level words
- 🟡 **B1 (Amber)**: Intermediate level words
- 🟠 **B2 (Orange)**: Upper intermediate level words
- 🔴 **C1 (Red)**: Advanced level words
- 🟤 **C2 (Dark Red)**: Proficiency level words
- ⚫ **OOV (Grey)**: Out of vocabulary words

## 📈 Analysis Capabilities

### Quantitative Metrics
- Agreement rate between methods
- Correlation coefficients
- Confusion matrices
- Distribution analysis

### Qualitative Insights
- Visual comparison of classification approaches
- Topic-specific difficulty patterns
- Method-specific strengths and weaknesses
