howeve you might want to track todos as well

good git ignore and push with all in main

prompt for central config:

Implement the Centralised Language Configuration Framework

Complete the LanguageConfig Dataclass and Enum:

Objective: Create a single, scalable source of truth for all language-specific parameters.

Action:

Expand the LanguageConfig dataclass to include fields for opus_dataset_code, word_regex_pattern, and cefr_word_list_path (which can be None).

Populate the SupportedLanguages enum with complete LanguageConfig objects for English, Spanish, French, and German. Research and provide sensible defaults for the new fields for each language.

Modify all functions (calculate_frequency_lexicon, load_cefr_data, etc.) to be driven exclusively by the properties of the passed LanguageConfig object, removing all hard-coded language-specific strings.

Implement Dynamic Language Switching and Graceful Degradation:

Objective: Allow the entire notebook's context to be switched via a single variable and handle cases where resources for a language are missing.

Action:

Ensure the DEFAULT_LANGUAGE enum variable at the top of the configuration cell correctly controls all subsequent processing.

In the section for Method D (Supervised ML), add a check for LANGUAGE_CONFIG.cefr_word_list_path. If it is None, the system must:

Skip the training and loading of the supervised model.

Log a clear warning that Method D is unavailable for the selected language.

Modify the METHOD_WEIGHTS in the get_ensemble_prediction function to exclude Method D (e.g., set its weight to 0 or remove it) for the current run, allowing the ensemble to function with the remaining methods.

AI generated and rated srt for measurement best from the dataset

turn this into proper project form and add basic UI


bertopic auto labelling of topics or use a cheap available llm to do this

might at the end add a translate to english step "within context" then determine the word difficulty

huge amounts of data or data augmentation techniques.. specially for method A


how is the performance? should we simplify the model? should we make it more complex and robust?

should we turn the step
