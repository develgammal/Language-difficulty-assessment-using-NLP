switch language to english as well as the subtitels file, dont delete ethe one in german but create another similar one in english then switch language to english
Treat Method A as the Gold Standard: Use Method A as your baseline.

Frame your project as "Can we improve upon the frequency model?" rather than "Which of these three is best?".

Refine Method A: You can improve the frequency method by applying some linguistic rules:

Give Proper Nouns a Boost: Use spaCy's Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify proper nouns and assign them an easier tier (e.g., A2/B1), as they are often cognates and easy to recognise.

Penalise Extreme Length: For words over a certain character count (e.g., >15), consider bumping their difficulty up by one tier to account for the cognitive load of reading compound words.

Rename method C to be called method D then since it will come last
add a method C which is a clustering algorthem ou already have most of these features from your work on Method D the model training "prev called method c" yo umight add more to them if you find they will help with the final result or leave it add this and then use the ones from them that you think are fit for method D "prev called method C" which uses for exmaple  K-Means clustering ou want to find. For instance, you could set k=6 to see if the model naturally discovers groups that correspond to the six CEFR levels. or tweak it to reach that goal, then we can use this as a feature in method C which is the training as well after we analyze which one of the clusters represent you know

also Performing comprehensive quantitative analysis took 15 minutes! make it shorter if possible or more efficient unless that would reduce the quality

also turn in on the option in bertopic that lets topics have names instead of just keywords you know i think it has a build in funciton that can do that

...................

strong typing centrally for supported languages include top 5 most common and throw error with instructoins wher eyou aupdate a central config that updates everywhere i nthe code with all links and configs of vsars relate dto that lang whether the opus lexicon or spacy version etc where theer is a dict used to strong type or enum those per each language including any specific regex they might need you know? so should they use add specific language they have everything they need to add in one place to change for everywhere

do topics have names from berttpoic

method d average out all ?
better if out of then use favouring c then a then b for next best answer ! with a note that this is anectodal from your observations

create custom srt using online sources even with preassumtptions that eval?

intro and outro update and sak ai to fill and fill and should refelct all methods

you can include code in first cell as link to github for prof?

update read me to reflect all changes

clean up all that inbetween steps

good git ignore and push
